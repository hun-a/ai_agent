  b. Gently toss tofu cubes in the marinade until fully coated. Cover and refrigerate 1–2 hours.  
  c. Preheat grill or broiler to medium-high. Thread tofu cubes onto soaked skewers, leaving a little space between each piece.  
  d. Grill or broil 3–4 minutes per side, brushing occasionally with leftover marinade, until golden char marks appear.  

2. Roast Lemon Potatoes

  b. In a roasting pan, combine olive oil, lemon juice, sliced garlic, oregano, salt, pepper and hot vegetable broth.  
  c. Add potato wedges and toss to coat evenly. Spread in a single layer.  
  d. Roast 40–50 minutes, turning once halfway, until potatoes are golden, crispy on the edges and tender inside.  

3. Prepare Horiatiki (Greek Village Salad)  
  a. In a large bowl, combine tomato wedges, cucumber slices, bell pepper, red onion and olives.  
  b. Drizzle with olive oil and red wine vinegar, sprinkle oregano, salt and pepper. Gently toss to combine.  
  c. Arrange block or crumbled vegetarian-friendly feta on top.  

4. Make Tzatziki  
  a. Grate cucumber, place in a clean kitchen towel or fine sieve and squeeze out excess moisture.  
  b. In a bowl, mix Greek yogurt, drained cucumber, minced garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, dill, salt and pepper until smooth.  
  c. Cover and chill at least 30 minutes to meld flavors.  

5. Warm Pita

Serving Suggestions

• Plating: Lay vegetarian souvlaki skewers on a large serving platter. Surround with roasted lemon potatoes. Place bowls of tzatziki and Greek salad alongside. Fan warm pita breads on one side.  
• Garnish: Sprinkle chopped parsley and a light dusting of dried oregano or sumac over the platter. Serve lemon wedges for squeezing.  
• Accompaniments: Offer extra olive oil for dipping, or small bowls of marinated olives and roasted red peppers.  
• Beverages: Pair with a crisp Assyrtiko or Moschofilero white wine, Retsina, or a non-alcoholic iced mountain tea or sparkling water with lemon.  
• Ambiance: Serve on simple white plates with linen napkins, drizzle olive oil from small cruets, and play traditional Greek music for an authentic touch.  

Explanation of Replaced Ingredients

• Tofu replaces chicken thighs as a high-protein, plant-based option. Pressing removes excess moisture so it absorbs the classic lemon-oregano marinade, giving a firm, meaty texture and char when grilled.  
• Vegetable broth substitutes chicken broth in the lemon potatoes for full vegetarian compliance without altering the bright, savory flavor.  
• Vegetarian-friendly feta ensures the salad remains authentic in taste and texture while respecting rennet restrictions.  
All other ingredients remain true to the original Greek flavors—olive oil, lemon, oregano, garlic—and maintain the dish’s delicious essence in a fully vegetarian form.
