Title:
Bracket of Heat â€” Episode 1: You Voted the Bracket! Quarterfinals Round 1

Run time target: 11â€“13 minutes

OVERVIEW / LOGLINE (one-sentence)
You voted the bracket â€” now watch as our hosts taste, roast, and crown "Show Winners" while YOU vote which sauces actually advance. Quarterfinals Round 1: two matchups, big reactions, and community power.

OPENING / TEASER (0:00â€“0:25)
B-roll montage: close-ups of 8 bottles, slow-mo pour, host reaction, bracket graphic with flames, punchy music.
Voiceover/Host (VO/on-camera):
"You voted the bracket. Eight sauces enter. Only one can claim the throne. This is... the Bracket of Heat."

Title card sting: "Bracket of Heat â€” Episode 1"

INTRO + RULES (0:25â€“1:05) â€” Section 1: "How This Works"
On camera: Host at tasting table with 8 bottles, bracket board behind, two guest tasters flanking.
Host (on-camera):
"Welcome to Bracket of Heat â€” Iâ€™m [HOST NAME]. Quick rules: these eight sauces were seeded by YOU in our pre-launch poll. Each episode we do head-to-head matchups. Tonight: Quarterfinals Matches 1 and 2. For each sauce weâ€™ll do: chip, signature bite, and mix test. We score Flavor (1â€“10), Heat (1â€“10), Reusability (1â€“5). We give a Show Winner, but the Peopleâ€™s Vote decides who advances. Poll link in the pinned comment and description â€” vote now, youâ€™ve got 48 hours."
Co-host 1 (comic):
"And I cry into milk when my favorites lose. Just so you know."
Co-host 2 (food expert):
"Weâ€™ll judge on flavor, heat profile, balance, and whether youâ€™d actually put this on food more than once."

BRACKET REVEAL (1:05â€“2:00) â€” Section 2: "You Voted â€” Hereâ€™s the Bracket"
Visual: animated bracket fills in with bottle images, seed numbers, city flags if known.
Host (VO + on-camera):
"Hereâ€™s your bracket as voted by the community. Seed 1: [SAUCE A â€” replace with final name]. Seed 2: [SAUCE B]. Seed 3: [SAUCE C]. Seed 4: [SAUCE D]. Seed 5: [SAUCE E]. Seed 6: [SAUCE F]. Seed 7: [SAUCE G]. Seed 8: [SAUCE H]. Tonightâ€™s matches: Match 1 â€” Seed 1 vs Seed 8. Match 2 â€” Seed 4 vs Seed 5. Matches 3 and 4 will be in Episode 2. Also â€” tease: Episode 3 will include wildcard rematch voting."
On-screen tiles for each bottle show: seed, Scoville (if known), main pepper, origin, price/oz, and a 3-word "mood" tag (e.g., "Garlic King", "Vinegar Punch").

TASTE STATION SETUP (2:00â€“2:30) â€” Section 3: "Format & Safety"
Quick camera pan of tasting stations: chips, nuggets, rice cake, labeled tasting spoons, water, milk, towel, first-aid kit.
Host:
"Format: three tests per sauce. 1) Clean chip, 2) Signature bite (nugget), 3) Mix test (small on rice cake). Score: Flavor 1â€“10, Heat 1â€“10, Reusability 1â€“5. Reaction Score (1â€“10) is our entertainment meter. Safety note: If you have pepper allergies, pregnancy, or heart issues, donâ€™t try this at home. Milk and water are ready."

MATCH 1 â€” SEED 1 vs SEED 8 (2:30â€“5:00) â€” Section 4: "Quarterfinal Match 1"
Intro graphic: "MATCH 1 â€” [Seed 1] vs [Seed 8]"
Host (taunting, holding Seed 8 bottle):
"This is heavy favorite vs underdog. Seed 1's a crowd fave â€” can Seed 8 pull the upset?"

Round structure (repeatable exact sequence for both matches):
1) Smell & first impression (each taster 5â€“8s)
- Host sniff and quick descriptor â€” add sensory language (e.g., "bright citrus ... roasted pepper ... molasses-sweet baseline").
- Co-host 1 reaction/comic aside.
- Co-host 2 technical note on pepper type and acid.

2) Chip taste (on-camera reaction + scoring)
- Host dips chip, bites, reacts, gives scores out loud.
- Example host line after chip:
"Flavor: 8/10 â€” big lime and roasted pepper. Heat: 5/10 on the front, but it lingers. Reusability: 4/5 â€” would put on tacos and grilled corn."

3) Nugget taste (on-camera reaction + scoring)
- Co-host 2 tries on chicken nugget, comments on how heat shifts with fat.
- Example line:
"On chicken it calms a touch and turns savory-sweet. Heat creeps to 6/10."

4) Mix test (rice cake) â€” texture/pairing note.
- Host:
"On the rice cake it's less violent â€” brightens it. Pairing potential: breakfast? maybe."

5) Final summary & Show Winner call
- Host tallies: "Flavor 8 + Heat 6 + Reusability 4 = Show Score 18/25. Reaction: 7/10."
- Display on-screen scoring card with animated sliders.
- Host (dramatic):
"Show Winner: Seed 1. But remember â€” YOU vote. If the people pick Seed 8, thatâ€™s a Peopleâ€™s Upset. Poll opens now."

Editor notes here: include 2â€“3 slow-mo cutaways of host reaction, label close-up, pour shot â€” clip these into shorts.

MATCH 2 â€” SEED 4 vs SEED 5 (5:00â€“7:30) â€” Section 5: "Quarterfinal Match 2"
Intro graphic: "MATCH 2 â€” [Seed 4] vs [Seed 5]"
Host (on-camera):
"Match 2 â€” two middle seeds. Prepare for the unexpected."
Repeat tasting sequence: smell, chip, nugget, mix test, scoring.

Key comedic/dramatic beats to script:
- If Seed 5 is a "supermarket underdog" surprise, highlight price vs performance:
Co-host 1 (after chip):
"This tastes like someone paid way too much to bottle flavor... and itâ€™s a bargain."
Host (on-screen stat tile): "Price: $X / oz â€” Value Score: 9/10"
- Finalize Show Winner, show on-screen card. Example:
"Show Winner: Seed 5. This one impressed the table. Poll live â€” choose who advances."

COMMUNITY CTA & ENGAGEMENT HOOK (7:30â€“8:10) â€” Section 6: "You Decide â€” Vote Now"
Host (lean forward):
"You voted the bracket. Now make the call. Poll link is pinned in the top comment, live on the YouTube community tab, and in our IG stories. Poll closes in 48 hours. Vote and leave a one-line argument in the comments â€” best argument will be pinned and get a shoutout in Episode 2. One random voter gets a sample bottle pack."
Pinned comment copy (ready to paste):
"ðŸ”¥ VOTE NOW: Poll link â€” Poll closes in 48 hours! Which show winner should advance to the semis: [Seed 1] or [Seed 8]? Vote and reply WHY for a chance to be shouted out and win a sauce pack. #BracketOfHeat"

MID-ROLL EDU-BITE (8:10â€“8:40) â€” Section 7: "Hot Sauce 101 â€” What Makes a Champion?"
Quick 25â€“30s segment with kinetic graphics:
Host (VO/on-camera):
"A champion sauce has three things: a memorable hook (flavor), a heat rhythm (where it hits â€” front, throat, lingering), and replay value (you want it on your food every week). If it nails those, it's tournament-ready."
Micro visual bullets: Balance (acidity vs sweetness), Spike Pattern, Versatility.

TEASER: NEXT EPISODE + WILDCARD (8:40â€“9:10) â€” Section 8: "Whatâ€™s Next (and a Wildcard)"
Host:
"Next episode we cover Matches 3 and 4. Plus â€” weâ€™re letting you nominate one eliminated sauce for a Wildcard rematch in Episode 3. We'll reveal the Peopleâ€™s Winners at the top of Episode 2 and feature top voters live. Also â€” a surprise creator guest may drop in. Be there for the tiebreaker live vote."

FINAL SCORES + MONTAGE (9:10â€“10:00) â€” Section 9: "Recap & Best Reactions"
Fast montage: best facecam reactions, slow-motion pours, scoreboard overlays. Show cards for each match with Show Winner and on-screen CTA: "VOTE NOW â€” 48 hours."
Host (VO):
"Recap â€” Show Winners: Match 1: [Seed 1]. Match 2: [Seed 5]. Your votes decide who moves on."

OUTRO (10:00â€“10:30) â€” Section 10: "Close & CTAs"
Host (on-camera):
"Subscribe to watch the bracket unfold. Follow us on TikTok and IG for daily clips. Use #BracketOfHeat when you recreate any taste test â€” weâ€™ll feature the best. Vote now (link pinned). See you at the Gauntlet."
Co-host 1 (gag):

END CARD + PROMO (10:30â€“10:40)
Visual: Social handles, sponsor logo (if any), Episode 2 premiere date/time.

POST-CREDITS GAG (10:40â€“10:50)
Co-host 1 tries a spoonful off-camera, immediately panics and yells for milk. Freeze-frame, comedic sound cue, roll out.

"Create a high-energy YouTube thumbnail: split-screen composition. Left: extreme close-up of the main host mid-reaction â€” mouth open, eyes wide, sweat/tear of spice visible, dramatic shadow. Right: two hot sauce bottles facing each other (bottle labels visible but generic), flames and bracket lines between them. Bold, readable text across bottom: 'YOU VOTED â€” WHO WINS?' Use warm color palette (reds, oranges, yellow), sharp contrast, cinematic lighting. Include small corner tag: 'Episode 1' and a tiny '48H Vote' badge.

FAQ / QUICK RESPONSES (for host to reuse in live chat)
Q: How are the sauces chosen?
A: Chosen by community nomination + seeding poll. We displayed the seed leaderboard in the pre-launch community post.

Q: Are you paid by brands?
A: If a sponsor is in the episode, it will be clearly disclosed on-screen and in the description. We taste everything honestly.

Q: Can I nominate a sauce for the wildcard?
A: Yes â€” the wildcard nomination link is in the pinned comment after the episode; top nominated eliminated sauce goes to a sudden-death match in Episode 3.

FINAL PUNCH / PRODUCTION CHECKLIST (shoot-ready)

If you want, I can:

- Draft Episode 2 script (remaining quarterfinals + reveal of Peopleâ€™s Winners + wildcard mechanics) timed for the same runtime.
